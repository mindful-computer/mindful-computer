# Feed Protocol  
### The Mindful Information Layer for the Agentic Internet  
**Version 0.3 — White Paper**
by Mindful Computer

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Feed Protocol** is an open, interoperable standard for curating and distributing information intentionally across the web.  
It empowers both humans and AI agents to design their own information flow — across social, news, commerce, and on-chain ecosystems — without dependence on opaque algorithms or centralized feeds.

Modern feeds are engineered for attention, not awareness. They overwhelm instead of empower.  
Feed reverses that dynamic. It introduces a new way to experience data — one grounded in clarity, context, and user intent.

By combining open standards, decentralized infrastructure, and AI-native semantics, Feed transforms how humans and intelligent agents interact with information. It is designed not to compete for attention, but to **return it** — enabling a more mindful, agentic web where discovery is intentional and personal data sovereignty is the norm.

---

## 2. Vision  
### From Noise to Nuance — Building a More Mindful Internet

Feed envisions a world where information isn’t something that happens *to* you but *for* you.  
Where feeds no longer dictate your reality, but reflect your awareness.

The protocol serves as the foundation for this shift — a **mindful information layer** that empowers users and AI agents to curate the signals that truly matter.  

Our goal is to help people move from passive consumption to **active intention**, and to equip intelligent systems with the same values: transparency, balance, and respect for attention.

We believe the future of intelligence — human or artificial — depends on being mindfully aware of all that we consume and create.  
Feed exists to make that possible.

---

## 3. Background and Context

The feed has become the dominant interface for how humans experience the internet.  
But today’s feeds are closed, opaque, and extractive — engineered to hold attention rather than cultivate understanding.

RSS offered a vision of open aggregation, but it lacked adaptability and incentives.  
Bluesky’s AT Protocol revived open social graphs, but focuses primarily on identity and conversation.

Feed builds upon these foundations by introducing **semantic structure, agentic interaction, and mindful intent**.  
It is not just another social protocol — it is the connective tissue between information, intelligence, and awareness.

---

## 4. Problem Statement

### 4.1 User Problems
- Feeds are controlled by opaque, engagement-driven algorithms created by others.
- Users cannot define what truly matters to them.  
- Content, data, and preferences are fragmented across platforms.  
- Attention is consumed rather than respected.
- Users cannot share their feeds with others for enjoyment, education, and collaboration.

### 4.2 Builder Problems
- APIs are closed, inconsistent, or cost-prohibitive.
- Developers must rebuild feed logic repeatedly.
- No shared standard exists for cross-domain aggregation or personalization.

### 4.3 Ecosystem Impact
Centralized control has produced an attention economy that rewards noise, not knowledge.  
Feed offers a mindful alternative — one that values autonomy, transparency, and collaboration over manipulation.

## 5. Core Principles

1. **Openness** — Public, composable, and permissionless by design.  
2. **User Sovereignty** — Data, filters, and models belong to users, not platforms.  
3. **Interoperability** — Seamless across APIs, blockchains, and web standards.  
4. **Intentionality** — Information shaped by human and agentic purpose, not algorithmic impulse.  
5. **Extensibility** — Developers can build apps, agents, and tools atop a common protocol.

---

## 6. Architecture Overview

### 6.1 Components
- **Feed Nodes:** Aggregate and serve data streams to clients and agents.  
- **Feed Schema:** JSON or GraphQL-based format defining `FeedItem`, `FeedSource`, `FeedIntent`, and metadata.  
- **Auth Layer:** OAuth + decentralized identity (DID) for secure, user-centric access.  
- **Ranking Layer:** Optional AI/LLM scoring guided by user or agent intents.  
- **Storage Layer:** IPFS, Arweave, or encrypted cloud delivery to ensure data persistence and portability.

### 6.2 Lifecycle
1. **Ingestion** — APIs, RSS, blockchain events, or AI crawlers collect data.  
2. **Normalization** — Formats are standardized for unified consumption.  
3. **Personalization** — Local or federated agents filter and curate by intent.  
4. **Distribution** — Feeds are published, subscribed to, or monetized openly.

Feed’s design ensures that personalization happens *locally first*, preserving both privacy and autonomy.

## 7. The `feed://` URI Scheme  
### A Universal Address for Awareness

The **`feed://`** URI scheme extends the protocol’s interoperability into a universal human-readable format, similar to `mailto:` for email or `https://` for the web.  
It provides a common addressing system for both humans and agents to access, subscribe to, and share feeds in a standardized way.

### 7.1 Example URI Structures
- `feed://user/profile?user=user`
- `feed://user/timeline?user=user&privacy=public`
- `feed://post/view?id=12345`
- `feed://collection/favorites?share=user1,user2`

### 7.2 Privacy and Sharing Parameters
Each feed URI can include parameters for privacy and selective access:
- `privacy=public` — accessible to everyone.  
- `privacy=private` — only the creator.  
- `privacy=friends` — limited circle.  
- `share=user1,user2` — share with specific individuals or groups.

### 7.3 Protection and Governance
To prevent abuse and impersonation:
- Feeds are cryptographically signed with their creator’s **DID** or keypair.  
- A **registry layer** verifies authenticity and records metadata (without storing content).  
- Misuse or malicious feeds can be flagged through a transparent governance process (see Section 13).

By introducing `feed://`, Feed bridges human-readable simplicity with decentralized verification — a mindful approach to addressing and trust.

## 13. Governance, Registry, and Sustainability  
### Stewardship for the Mindful Internet

The longevity of Feed depends on **ethical governance** and **sustainable stewardship** — balancing decentralization with accountability.

### 13.1 Feed Foundation
A neutral nonprofit steward overseeing:
- Open standards and schema evolution.  
- Verification of `feed://` registry records.  
- Transparency reporting and public blacklists for malicious actors.  
- Annual “Feed Summit” bringing together builders, agents, and stewards.

**Funding Model:**
- Ecosystem membership dues (like W3C).  
- Grants from open-internet and AI ethics foundations.  
- Corporate sponsorship and developer partner tiers.  

### 13.2 Registry and Verification Layer
- Each Feed URI (`feed://user`) is tied to a **DID** or cryptographic keypair.  
- Registrations are signed and optionally mirrored on-chain.  
- Public metadata (not content) ensures authenticity.  
- Feeds can be verified, revoked, or flagged transparently via governance proposals.

### 13.3 Reputation and Attestation
- Decentralized reputation through **attestation layers** (e.g., Ethereum Attestation Service).  
- Feeds or agents build trust through verifiable social and network interactions.  
- Users control visibility thresholds (e.g., “show only feeds above X reputation”).

### 13.4 Funding Sustainability
| Source | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| **Grants & Public Funds** | Open-source development and research |
| **Memberships & Sponsorships** | Long-term protocol sustainability |
| **Optional Token Model** | Registry and DAO governance participation |
